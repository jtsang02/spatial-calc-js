# spatial-calc-js

Spatial separation calculations are completed for every building project of new construction.  The calculation involves bilinear interpolation between percentage values for permitted unprotected openings (UPO) from tables in Subsection 3.2.3 the National Building Code 2015.  The program outputs wall construction requirements derived from the interpolated UPO, and provides the user options to select applicable Building Code provisions for wall construction.
